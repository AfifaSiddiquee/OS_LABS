# üñ•Ô∏è Operating Systems Lab Manual ‚Äì NED University

Welcome to my Operating Systems Lab repository. This collection of C++ programs demonstrates fundamental OS concepts such as CPU scheduling, process synchronization, memory management, and file system simulations. Each lab was completed as part of the coursework at **NED University of Engineering & Technology**.

## üìö Lab List

### Lab 1: Introduction to UNIX
- Practiced and explored basic UNIX/Linux commands for file handling, process control, and system navigation.

---

### Lab 2: CPU Scheduling Algorithms
Simulated the following scheduling algorithms to calculate **Turnaround Time** and **Waiting Time**:
- [x] FCFS (First Come First Serve)
- [x] SJF (Shortest Job First)
- [x] Round Robin
- [x] Priority Scheduling

---

### Lab 3: Multithreading in C
- Developed a C program to demonstrate the simultaneous execution of multiple threads using the POSIX thread library (`pthread`).

---

### Lab 4: Producer-Consumer Problem
- Simulated the classic Producer-Consumer synchronization problem using **semaphores**.

---

### Lab 5: Readers-Writers Problem
- Implemented a solution to the Readers-Writers problem with mutual exclusion to ensure proper synchronization.

---

### Lab 6: Dining Philosophers Problem
- Simulated the **Dining Philosophers Problem** using semaphores to avoid deadlock and starvation.

---

### Lab 7: Banker's Algorithm
- Developed a C program to simulate the **Banker's Algorithm** for deadlock avoidance in a multi-resource environment.

---

### Lab 8: Deadlock Detection
- Created a simulation for detecting deadlocks in a system based on the allocation and request matrices.

---

### Lab 9: Contiguous Memory Allocation
Simulated three types of memory allocation strategies:
- [x] First-Fit
- [x] Best-Fit
- [x] Worst-Fit

---

### Lab 10: Paging Memory Management
- Simulated the **paging technique**, mapping logical addresses to physical memory using page tables.

---

### Lab 11: Segmentation
- Implemented the **segmentation technique** for memory management and simulated logical to physical address translation.

---

### Lab 12: Page Replacement Algorithms
Simulated the following page replacement strategies:
- [x] FIFO (First In First Out)
- [x] LRU (Least Recently Used)
- [x] Optimal
- [x] MRU (Most Recently Used)

---

### Lab 13: Disk Scheduling Algorithms
Simulated different disk scheduling algorithms for head movement:
- [x] FCFS
- [x] SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First)
- [x] SCAN (Elevator Algorithm)

---

### Lab 14: File Allocation Methods
Simulated the following file allocation strategies in C:
- [x] Sequential Allocation
- [x] Indexed Allocation
- [x] Linked Allocation
